# AcidRain
Tower defense game

Made for an Assignment for the University of Waterloo.
Entire Game was coded in c++ using Xlib.

All objects were created with code only with no images.

Commands to compile and run:

    g++ -o Tower Tower.cpp -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lstdc++
    ./Tower

Note: the -L option and -lstdc++ may not be needed on some machines.
